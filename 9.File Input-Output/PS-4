### A File CONTAINS A WORD "DONKEY" MULTIPLE TIMES. YOU NEED TO WRITE A PROGRAM WHICH REPLACES THIS WORD WITH ###### BY UPDATING THE SAME FILE.

word = "Donkey"

with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()

contentNew = content.replace(word, "######")

with open("file.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write(contentNew)
