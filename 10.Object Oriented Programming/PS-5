###WRITE A CLASS TRAIN WHICH HAS METHODS TO BOOK A TICKET , GET STATUS(NO.OF SETS ) & GET FARE INFORMATION OF TRAINS RUNNING UNDER INDIAN RAILWAYS

from random import randint  # Importing randint to generate random fare

# Define a Train class
class Train:
    # Constructor to initialize train number
    def __init__(self, trainNo):
        self.trainNo = trainNo

    # Method to book a ticket
    def book(self, fro, to):
        print(f"Ticket is booked in train no: {self.trainNo} from {fro} to {to}") 

    # Method to get train running status
    def getStatus(self):
        print(f"Train no: {self.trainNo} is running on time") 

    # Method to get random fare between two stations
    def getFare(self, fro, to):
        print(f"Ticket fare in train no: {self.trainNo} from {fro} to {to} is {randint(222, 5555)}")  

# Create an object of Train class
t = Train(11399)

# Call methods using object
t.book("Surat", "Delhi")
t.getStatus()
t.getFare("Surat", "Delhi")
