###CREATE A CLASS WITH A CLASS ATTRIBUT A; CREATE AN OBJECT FROM IT AND SET 'a' DIRECTLY USING object.a=o. DOES THIS CHANGE THE CLASS ATTRIBUTE?

class New:
  a = 4
o = New()
print(o.a) # Prints the class attribute because instance attribute is not present
o.a = 0 # Instance attribute is set
print(o.a) # Prints the instance attribute because instance attribute is present
print(New.a) # Prints the class attribute
