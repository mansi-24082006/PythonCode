###Find a remainder when a number is divided by 2.

# Input any two numbers
num1 = int(input("Enter dividend: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter divisor: "))

# Actual remainder calculation
remainder = num1 % num2

# Only show if remainder is 2
if remainder == 2:
    print(f"Remainder when {num1} is divided by {num2} is {remainder}")
else:
    print("The remainder is not 2.")
